DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE = """You are an expert evaluator of AI models. Follow the steps below:
1. Carefully compare the prediction generated by the model against the correct ground truth value and determine how much they differ.
Equally consider important semantic components of the response and details and numbers.
Note that in the ground truth values, <|OR|> indicates that only any of the values between the <|OR|> separators needs to be present.
<|AND|> indicates that all of the values between the <|AND|> separators should be present.
2. Assign a correctness score for the predicted value. Only provide a numeric score between 0.0 and 1.0. Do not provide rationale or other text; ONLY write the score.

Example:
Ground truth: The multi-axes chart titled "Healthcare and Health Analysis: Cost, Coverage, and Premiums" presents data across several healthcare categories.
Private Health Insurance leads in cost at $98,800 and covers 9,502 patients with an average premium of $3,760 and 6 insurers.
Outpatient Care costs $70,000, covers 8,502 patients, with $4,500 average premiums and 4 insurers.
Inpatient Care shows $80,000 in costs, 6,200 patients, a $3,500 average premium, and 5 insurers.
Mental Health Care has a $60,000 cost, covers 4,200 patients, and has $4,000 average premiums with the highest number of insurers at 7.
Dental Care has a $54,000 cost for 3,000 patients covered, a $3,000 average premium, and 9 insurers.
Vision Care, at $18,000 cost, covers the fewest patients, 1,500, with a $2,500 average premium and 3 insurers.
Lastly, Prescription Drugs cost $20,000, cover 5,000 patients, and have a $2,600 average premium with 4 insurers.
Prediction: The bar chart visualizes the cost in dollars across different healthcare categories, along with the number of patients covered, average premiums, and number of insurers.
The healthcare categories include Private Health Insurance with 9,500 patients, Outpatient Care with 8,500 patients, Inpatient Care with 6,000 patients,
Mental Health Care with 4,000 patients, Dental Care with 3,000 patients, Vision Care with 1,000 patients, and Prescription Drugs with 5,000 patients.
Costs are represented by blue bars, patients covered by a blue line, average premiums by pink markers connected with lines, and insurers indicated on the secondary y-axis.

class AzureOpenAITextModelCategoricalScore(AzureOpenAITextModelCategoricalEvaluatorBase):
    """
    Prompt-tuned evaluator that uses single-turn text-only calls to an Azure OpenAI model for evaluation and returns
    standard categorical metrics (precision, recall, F1, accuracy) based on the scores returned.

    Args:
        prompt_template: string template for the prompt instructing how to score the prediction. Must have two placeholders: <|prediction|> and <|target|>.
        positive_threshold: determines the threshold (inclusive) at which the score assigned by the model to the prediction means the prediction is correct. Range: [0.0, 1.0].
        negative_value: indicates the value (e.g., None, 'null', 0, '', []) for which predicted and target values are considered null. Note that the evaluator strictly requires
                        an exact match for either a prediction or target to be considered negative.

        Other parameters follow the standards of irisml.tasks.create_azure_openai_chat_model.OpenAITextChatModel;
