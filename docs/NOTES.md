- `visionmetrics` uses a strict thresholding. For e.g., if thres=0.3 and pred=0.3, it will be counted as a negative prediction. This is different from the behavior of `vision-evaluation` repo which counts it as a positive prediction. 

- For the IC Accuracy metric, `visionmetrics` does not support samples-based averaging like `sklearn`. Supported averaging methods are `macro`, `micro`, `weighted`, and `none`.
